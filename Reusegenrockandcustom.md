Reusing components between a **custom setup** (using tools like Great Expectations, Durable Rules, and Robot Framework) and **GenRocket** can improve efficiency and reduce redundancy. While both serve different primary purposes, there are commonalities that can bridge their use cases. Below are areas where you can maximize reuse:

---

### **1. Test Data**
- **Generated Data Reuse**:
  - Use **GenRocket** to generate synthetic test data and feed it into the **custom setup** for further validation and rule execution.
  - Store generated data in a common format (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) so it can be consumed by other tools.

- **Shared Data Sources**:
  - Both setups can leverage the same databases, APIs, or flat files as the source or destination of data.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Generate data in GenRocket.
2. Validate the generated data with Great Expectations.
3. Execute business rules on the validated data with Durable Rules.

---

### **2. Rule Definitions**
- **Centralized Business Rules**:
  - Define business rules in a **shared repository** (e.g., JSON or YAML).
  - Use these rules in GenRocket for data generation constraints and in Durable Rules for runtime validation.

#### Example Rule (JSON):
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "AgeValidation",
      "condition": "age > 18",
      "action": "grant_access"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Reuse Strategy**:
  - Import the same rules into GenRocket's generators.
  - Load rules into Durable Rules for execution during validation.

---

### **3. Test Scenarios**
- **Shared Test Case Design**:
  - Design test scenarios in a **common format** (e.g., Robot Framework or plain text).
  - Use these scenarios to generate data in GenRocket and validate data or rules in the custom setup.

#### Example Test Case Template:
```yaml
- Scenario: Validate Access
  Input: {"age": 20}
  ExpectedResult: "grant_access"
```

- **Reuse Strategy**:
  - Use the input fields in GenRocket for data generation.
  - Pass the same inputs and expected results into Durable Rules for rule execution.

---

### **4. Validation Framework**
- **Great Expectations Integration**:
  - Validate data consistency using Great Expectations before and after GenRocket's data generation.
  - Reuse expectation suites for data generated by GenRocket and data consumed by Durable Rules.

#### Example:
- Validate column constraints in Great Expectations:
  ```python
  dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_between("age", 18, 100)
  ```

- Apply the same constraints in GenRocket's generators.

---

### **5. Reporting**
- **Unified Reporting**:
  - Combine **GenRocket's data generation logs** with validation results from Great Expectations and rule execution outcomes from Durable Rules.
  - Use a shared reporting platform (e.g., Robot Framework's HTML logs, Data Docs, or a custom dashboard).

#### Example Integration:
- Include GenRocketâ€™s generated data stats (record count, distributions) in the final Robot Framework report.
- Attach Great Expectations Data Docs and Durable Rules logs to provide a holistic view.

---

### **6. CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Common Automation Pipelines**:
  - Use the same CI/CD pipeline to trigger both GenRocket data generation and custom validation tests.
  - Share environment variables, configurations, and execution steps between the two setups.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Generate data using GenRocket as the first pipeline stage.
2. Run custom setup tests (Great Expectations, Durable Rules, Robot Framework) on the generated data.
3. Publish combined results to a shared report.

---

### **7. Environment Setup**
- **Shared Docker Environments**:
  - Create Docker containers with pre-installed dependencies for GenRocket, Great Expectations, Durable Rules, and Robot Framework.
  - Use the same environment across teams to reduce setup time.

---

### **8. Libraries and Utilities**
- **Shared Code and Functions**:
  - Reuse Python utilities for tasks like data transformations, logging, and file I/O across both setups.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def load_data(file_path):
        import pandas as pd
        return pd.read_csv(file_path)

    def log_message(message):
        print(message)
    ```

---

### **9. Error Handling**
- **Standardized Error Tracking**:
  - Use a unified error-handling mechanism (e.g., log files, monitoring tools like ELK or Splunk) to capture issues across both GenRocket and the custom setup.
  - Define shared error codes or messages to simplify debugging.

---

### **10. Test Data Masking**
- **Reusable Masking Rules**:
  - Use the same masking logic in both setups to handle sensitive data.
  - GenRocket supports built-in masking; this logic can be replicated in the custom setup using Python libraries like **Faker**.

#### Example:
- Masking in GenRocket:
  ```json
  "rule": {
    "name": "MaskSSN",
    "type": "ReplaceDigits",
    "pattern": "###-##-####"
  }
  ```
- Masking in Python:
  ```python
  from faker import Faker
  fake = Faker()
  print(fake.ssn())
  ```
