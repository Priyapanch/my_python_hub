Using **Great Expectations** for data validation and **Durable Rules** for business rule validation in a **Robot Framework** setup allows for seamless integration of ETL testing and decision-based validations. Below is a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Great Expectations for Data Selection**
Great Expectations ensures that your data meets quality requirements by defining expectations (rules) for data selection.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Install Great Expectations:**
   ```bash
   pip install great_expectations
   ```

2. **Create a Data Context:**
   Initialize a project:
   ```bash
   great_expectations --v3-api init
   ```

3. **Define Expectations:**
   Create an expectation suite to validate the selection criteria:
   ```python
   from great_expectations.dataset import PandasDataset
   import pandas as pd

   # Sample Data
   data = {'age': [20, 17, 30], 'status': ['valid', 'invalid', 'valid']}
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Create Expectations
   dataset = PandasDataset(df)
   dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_between("age", 18, 100)
   dataset.expect_column_values_to_match_set("status", {"valid", "invalid"})

   # Validate Data
   result = dataset.validate()
   print(result)
   ```

4. **Save Expectations**:
   Save the suite to reuse across datasets.

#### **Integrate with Robot Framework:**
   - Use `Process` or `Python` libraries to run Great Expectations validations from Robot Framework.
   - Example keyword:
     ```robot
     *** Keywords ***
     Validate Data Selection
         Run Process    python    -c    ${validation_script}
     ```

### **2. Durable Rules for Business Rule Validation**
Durable Rules is a Python library for automating business logic using rulesets.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Install Durable Rules:**
   ```bash
   pip install durable-rules
   ```

2. **Define Business Rules:**
   Example rule to grant access based on age:
   ```python
   from durable.lang import *

   with ruleset('access_rules'):
       @when_all(c.age > 18)
       def grant_access(c):
           c.assert_fact({'status': 'access_granted'})

       @when_all(c.age <= 18)
       def deny_access(c):
           c.assert_fact({'status': 'access_denied'})

   def validate_rule(input_data):
       post('access_rules', input_data)
   ```

3. **Integrate with Robot Framework:**
   Write a Python wrapper to validate rules:
   ```python
   def execute_rule(input_data):
       from durable.lang import post
       post('access_rules', input_data)
       return {"status": "Rule executed"}
   ```

   Add it as a keyword in Robot Framework:
   ```robot
   *** Keywords ***
   Execute Business Rule
       [Arguments]    ${input_data}
       ${result}=     Evaluate Rule Engine    ${input_data}
       [Return]       ${result}
   ```

---

### **3. Full Robot Framework Workflow**
Integrate both Great Expectations and Durable Rules into your test cases.

#### **Test Case Example:**
```robot
*** Settings ***
Library           Process
Library           Collections
Library           PythonLib    path_to_your_script.py

*** Variables ***
${INPUT_DATA}     {'age': 20, 'status': 'valid'}
${RULE_INPUT}     {'age': 20}

*** Test Cases ***
Validate Data and Rules
    Validate Data Selection
    ${rule_result}=    Execute Business Rule    ${RULE_INPUT}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${rule_result['status']}    Rule executed
```

---

### **4. CI/CD Integration**
- Combine the above setup in a pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
- Use Docker containers to ensure a consistent environment.

---

### **5. Enhance with Reports**
- Use Great Expectations’ Data Docs for reporting data validation results.
- Log Durable Rules outcomes and integrate with Robot Framework reports.

=========≈=============

Enhancing reports in a setup that combines **Great Expectations**, **Durable Rules**, and **Robot Framework** involves creating detailed, user-friendly, and actionable reports for both data validation and rule execution. Here's how to achieve this:

---

### **1. Enhancing Great Expectations Reports**
Great Expectations generates **Data Docs**, which are interactive and visually appealing reports for data validation results.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Enable Data Docs:**
   - Configure `great_expectations.yml` to define where to save the Data Docs.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     data_docs_sites:
       local_site:
         class_name: SiteBuilder
         store_backend:
           class_name: FilesystemStoreBackend
           base_directory: great_expectations/uncommitted/data_docs/local_site/
         site_index_builder:
           class_name: DefaultSiteIndexBuilder
     ```

2. **Generate Reports:**
   After validation, generate the Data Docs:
   ```bash
   great_expectations --v3-api docs build
   ```

3. **Share Reports:**
   - Host Data Docs on a shared server or send them as links to stakeholders.

#### **Customization Options:**
- Use a custom `expectation_suite_name` for better organization.
- Annotate expectations with descriptive `meta` tags for better clarity in reports.

---

### **2. Enhancing Durable Rules Reports**
Durable Rules doesn't have built-in reporting, but you can enhance it by logging rule execution results and integrating them with a reporting framework.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Capture Rule Execution Logs:**
   - Add a logging mechanism to your rule engine:
     ```python
     import logging

     logging.basicConfig(filename="rule_execution.log", level=logging.INFO)

     with ruleset('access_rules'):
         @when_all(c.age > 18)
         def grant_access(c):
             logging.info(f"Access granted for age: {c.age}")
             c.assert_fact({'status': 'access_granted'})

         @when_all(c.age <= 18)
         def deny_access(c):
             logging.info(f"Access denied for age: {c.age}")
             c.assert_fact({'status': 'access_denied'})
     ```

2. **Generate Custom Reports:**
   - Parse logs and generate reports using a library like **pandas** or **matplotlib**.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     logs = pd.read_csv("rule_execution.log", sep=" ", header=None)
     logs.columns = ["Timestamp", "Level", "Message"]
     logs.to_html("rule_report.html")
     ```

3. **Integrate with Robot Framework Reports:**
   - Use the `Log` keyword in Robot Framework to include rule results in its reports:
     ```robot
     *** Keywords ***
     Log Rule Execution
         [Arguments]    ${message}
         Log To Console    ${message}
         Log    ${message}
     ```

---

### **3. Enhancing Robot Framework Reports**
Robot Framework has built-in HTML and log reporting, which can be customized.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Add Tags and Metadata:**
   Use tags and metadata to organize test cases and make reports more meaningful:
   ```robot
   *** Test Cases ***
   Validate Data and Rules
       [Tags]    DataValidation    RuleValidation
       Validate Data Selection
       Execute Business Rule    {'age': 20}
   ```

2. **Use Detailed Logging:**
   Log detailed messages and outputs in Robot Framework:
   ```robot
   Log    Data validation passed for input: ${input_data}
   Log    Rule executed successfully with result: ${result}
   ```

3. **Integrate External Reports:**
   - Embed Great Expectations Data Docs or Durable Rules logs into Robot Framework reports using the `Log` or `Attach` keywords.
   - Example:
     ```robot
     Attach File    path/to/data_docs/index.html    Data Docs Report
     Attach File    path/to/rule_report.html        Rule Execution Report
     ```

---

### **4. Combining Reports**
Aggregate outputs from all tools into a single report or dashboard:
- **Use a Dashboard Tool**: Tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, or **Streamlit** can create unified dashboards.
- **HTML Report Consolidation**: Combine Data Docs, rule logs, and Robot Framework logs into a single HTML report.

---

### **5. Automating Report Generation in CI/CD**
1. **Run Tests Automatically:**
   Use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or another CI/CD tool to run tests and generate reports.
   - Example: Publish Great Expectations Data Docs to a web server.

2. **Post-Execution Scripts:**
   Add a script to parse and enhance reports after test execution.

3. **Send Notifications:**
   Use email or Slack notifications to send reports or links to stakeholders.

By following these steps, you can create comprehensive, actionable reports that enhance visibility into the validation and rule execution processes. Let me know if you want code examples for any specific step!
