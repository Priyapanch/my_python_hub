# **Proof of Concept (PoC) Plan: AI-Driven Security & Compliance for AWS Glue & Step Functions**  

## **1. PoC Objectives**  
The goal of this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to validate the impact of **Amazon Q Developer** on:  
- **AI-driven security and compliance enforcement** in AWS Glue and Step Functions.  
- **Performance optimization** of Glue jobs while ensuring adherence to **AWS security best practices**.  
- **Governance and auditability** of Step Functions workflows in **a secure and compliant manner**.  

---

## **2. Scope & Success Criteria**  

### **Scope**  
The PoC will focus on:  
1. **Secure AWS Glue Job Development**  
   - Validate AI-assisted generation of **PySpark scripts** with **automated security recommendations** (IAM policies, encryption, logging).  
   - Assess compliance enforcement for **GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and AWS security controls**.  

2. **Governed Step Functions Orchestration**  
   - Validate AI-assisted **ASL (Amazon States Language) generation** with security enhancements (fine-grained IAM policies, retries, and error handling).  
   - Ensure **auditability of state transitions** using **AWS CloudTrail**.  

3. **Security & Compliance Monitoring**  
   - Implement **automated security scanning** using **AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and AWS Config**.  
   - Ensure **continuous compliance checks** in the CI/CD pipeline.  

### **Success Criteria**  
✅ **Security Compliance Validation**: AI-generated code should comply with **AWS Security Hub and CIS benchmarks**.  
✅ **Performance Optimization**: AI-driven Glue optimizations should **reduce job execution time by at least 20%**.  
✅ **Automated Compliance Audits**: Security policies and configurations should be **automatically enforced and logged**.  
✅ **Governance & Traceability**: Step Functions logs should provide **audit trails for all workflow transitions**.  

---

## **3. Pilot Use Cases**  

### **Use Case 1: Secure & Compliant AWS Glue Job Development**  
**Scenario**: AI-assisted Glue job development with **automated security and performance checks**.  
- **Amazon Q Developer** generates PySpark scripts with **IAM role enforcement, logging, and encryption settings**.  
- Glue jobs will process sensitive data stored in **Amazon S3**, ensuring **KMS-based encryption and access control**.  
- Validate **automated threat detection** using AWS GuardDuty.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
✅ **20-30% faster Glue job development** with **built-in security recommendations**.  
✅ **Zero critical security misconfigurations** detected in **AWS Security Hub scans**.  

---

### **Use Case 2: AI-Optimized Step Functions Workflow with Security Controls**  
**Scenario**: AI-generated Step Functions workflows with **secure IAM role assignments and compliance tracking**.  
- **Amazon Q Developer** suggests **optimized ASL definitions**, ensuring:  
  - **IAM least-privilege policies** for Lambda and Glue execution roles.  
  - **Logging & auditability** via CloudWatch and CloudTrail.  
- Enforce **error handling and retry strategies** using AI-driven recommendations.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
✅ **AI-generated workflows reduce manual ASL coding time by 30%**.  
✅ **100% IAM role compliance with least-privilege access enforcement**.  
✅ **Step Functions executions fully logged and auditable**.  

---

### **Use Case 3: CI/CD Security & Compliance Automation**  
**Scenario**: Automate **security scanning and compliance enforcement** in CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Amazon Q Developer** integrates with **GitHub Actions / AWS CodePipeline** to:  
  - Run **automated security checks** before deployment.  
  - Enforce **encryption, access controls, and least-privilege IAM policies**.  
  - Generate **compliance reports (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA) for audit purposes**.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
✅ **Security misconfigurations detected before deployment**.  
✅ **Automated compliance validation** reducing audit overhead.  
✅ **Seamless integration into existing CI/CD pipelines**.
