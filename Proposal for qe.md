### **One-Page Proposal: Quick Quality Improvement for AWS ETL Project**  

#### **Background**  
The ETL project, developed in AWS using Glue and RDS PostgreSQL, faces quality challenges due to:  
- **Lack of structured testing** (leading to recurring production defects).  
- **Poor test data quality** (causing unexpected failures).  
- **Limited investment in QE** (delays in identifying and resolving issues).  

Without proper testing, production issues continue to impact stability, increasing rework and operational costs.  

---

### **Proposed Solution**  
To improve quality **without major investment**, we propose lightweight solutions focused on **data validation, automated checks, and early defect detection**:  

#### **1. Implement Great Expectations for Data Validation** *(Already Suggested)*  
✅ Define **data quality rules** (schema checks, duplicates, missing values).  
✅ Integrate validation with **AWS Glue & RDS PostgreSQL** to catch issues early.  
✅ Automate test runs as part of **ETL pipeline execution**.  

**Impact:** Reduces bad data loads, prevents inconsistent transformations.  

#### **2. Automate Basic ETL Validations in CI/CD**  
✅ Add **sanity checks** for data consistency in the deployment pipeline.  
✅ Run **schema drift detection** for database changes.  
✅ Alert teams on failures using **AWS CloudWatch & SNS**.  

**Impact:** Ensures smooth deployments, catches breaking changes before release.  

#### **3. Improve Test Data with Synthetic & Production-Based Samples**  
✅ Extract **sanitized production data** for test scenarios.  
✅ Use **Python scripts or AWS Glue transformations** to generate missing edge cases.  
✅ Automate test data setup to ensure **consistent test runs**.  

**Impact:** Eliminates common data-related failures, improves regression coverage.  

#### **4. Introduce Lightweight Automated Regression Tests**  
✅ Use **Robot Framework or Pytest** for simple API & DB validations.  
✅ Automate **critical business checks** (data completeness, field transformations).  
✅ Run **quick smoke tests** on every deployment.  

**Impact:** Reduces manual testing effort, catches issues before they reach production.

### **Expected Benefits**  
✔ **Fewer Production Defects** – Catch errors before they impact end users.  
✔ **Faster Debugging** – Improve visibility into data failures and ETL issues.  
✔ **Lower Maintenance Costs** – Reduce time spent on fixing bad data loads.  
✔ **Higher Stability** – Prevent schema changes and broken transformations from reaching production.

### **Next Steps**  
- **Week 1-2:** Set up Great Expectations in Glue for automated data checks.  
- **Week 3-4:** Implement lightweight ETL validations in CI/CD.  
- **Week 5-6:** Automate test data setup and introduce regression checks.  

This plan delivers **quick quality wins** without requiring large investments. We recommend an **initial 6-week implementation** to demonstrate impact.  

Would you like me to refine this based on your audience (technical, business, leadership)?
