### **One-Page Proposal: Quick Quality Improvement for AWS ETL Project**  

Here are three tailored versions of the proposal:  

---

## **1. Technical Version (For Engineers & Architects)**  

### **Background**  
The AWS ETL pipeline (Glue & RDS PostgreSQL) is facing recurring **data quality issues** due to:  
- **Missing test data validation** in the pipeline.  
- **Schema inconsistencies** between source and target tables.  
- **No automated checks** for data correctness.  

Without these, **data corruption and incorrect transformations** lead to **production failures**.  

### **Proposed Solution**  

#### **1. Great Expectations for Data Validation** *(Already Suggested)*  
âœ… Define **data quality rules** (schema, duplicates, completeness checks).  
âœ… Integrate validation with **AWS Glue & RDS PostgreSQL**.  
âœ… Automate data validation as part of **ETL job execution**.  

#### **2. ETL Validations in CI/CD Pipeline**  
âœ… Automate **sanity checks** for data consistency.  
âœ… Detect schema drifts before deployment.  
âœ… Use **AWS CloudWatch & SNS** for failure alerts.  

#### **3. Test Data Improvement**  
âœ… Extract **sanitized production data** for test scenarios.  
âœ… Use **Python scripts or Glue transformations** for synthetic data.  

#### **4. Lightweight Automated Regression Tests**  
âœ… Use **Robot Framework/Pytest** for API & DB validation.  
âœ… Automate **key transformation checks**.  

### **Expected Technical Benefits**  
âœ” **Faster debugging** with better visibility into data failures.  
âœ” **Less rework** by catching issues before deployment.  
âœ” **Improved performance** by preventing unnecessary reprocessing.  

### **Next Steps (6-Week Plan)**  
- **Weeks 1-2:** Implement Great Expectations checks.  
- **Weeks 3-4:** Set up CI/CD validation & alerts.  
- **Weeks 5-6:** Automate test data & regression tests.

## **2. Business Version (For Product Owners & Managers)**  

### **Problem Statement**  
The **AWS ETL pipeline** is experiencing **data quality issues**, leading to:  
- **Frequent production failures** affecting business users.  
- **Inconsistent reporting and analytics** due to bad data.  
- **Increased operational costs** for debugging and reprocessing.  

### **Proposed Quick Fixes**  
To **reduce defects without major investment**, we propose:  

#### **1. Automated Data Quality Checks (Great Expectations)**  
âœ… Validate data **before it enters RDS PostgreSQL**.  
âœ… Prevent **duplicate, missing, and incorrect data** from being loaded.  

#### **2. Early Issue Detection in CI/CD**  
âœ… Catch errors **before deployment** instead of fixing them later.  
âœ… Alert teams via **CloudWatch notifications**.  

#### **3. Improved Test Data Strategy**  
âœ… Use **real-world production samples** for testing.  
âœ… Automate test data generation for consistency.  

#### **4. Quick Automated Business Rule Tests**  
âœ… Ensure critical **data transformations are correct**.  
âœ… Run quick **smoke tests on every release**.  

### **Expected Business Benefits**  
âœ” **Fewer customer complaints** due to data errors.  
âœ” **Faster issue resolution**, reducing downtime.  
âœ” **Lower costs** by preventing rework and manual fixes.  

### **Next Steps (6-Week Rollout)**  
- **Weeks 1-2:** Set up automated data validation.

## **3. Leadership Version (For Directors & Executives)**  

### **Business Challenge**  
The **AWS ETL pipeline** is introducing **data quality issues**, resulting in:  
- **Operational inefficiencies** from frequent production failures.  
- **Delayed business insights** due to inconsistent data.  
- **Unnecessary rework costs** for fixing bad data post-deployment.  

### **Quick & Cost-Effective Quality Fixes**  
Without requiring a major **QE investment**, we propose:  

#### **1. Automated Data Quality Validation**  
âœ… Use **Great Expectations** to prevent bad data loads.  
âœ… Integrate validation directly into **AWS Glue & RDS PostgreSQL**.  

#### **2. Early Risk Detection in CI/CD**  
âœ… Stop defective data pipelines **before they reach production**.  
âœ… Automate alerts & monitoring **via AWS CloudWatch**.  

#### **3. Test Data Standardization**  
âœ… Ensure **clean, realistic data** for testing.  
âœ… Reduce **inconsistencies** with automated test data generation.  

### **Expected Business Impact**  
âœ” **Faster, more reliable data insights** for decision-making.  
âœ” **Reduced operational costs** by preventing post-release fixes.  
âœ” **Increased stability** of ETL pipelines.  

### **Proposed 6-Week Implementation Plan**  
- **Weeks 1-2:** Deploy automated data validation.  
- **Weeks 3-4:** Integrate error detection into CI/CD.  
- **Weeks 5-6:** Improve test data and introduce automation.  

**Result:** Higher **data reliability, fewer disruptions, and reduced costs**, all with a minimal testing investment.

Each version focuses on what matters most to the respective audience:  
- **Technical:** Implementation, debugging, and performance.  
- **Business:** Stability, efficiency, and customer impact.  
- **Leadership:** Cost savings, risk reduction, and ROI.
