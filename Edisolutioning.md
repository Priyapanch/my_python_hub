Let’s create a custom solution for processing and validating **healthcare EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) claim data** using **Great Expectations** for data validation, **Durable Rules** for business rule execution, and **Robot Framework** for automation and reporting. We'll focus on the following tasks:

1. **Data Preparation**: Simulate EDI 837 claim data.
2. **Validation**: Use Great Expectations to validate the data structure and content.
3. **Business Rule Execution**: Use Durable Rules to apply custom healthcare business rules.
4. **Automation**: Integrate validation and rule execution into Robot Framework for a complete workflow.

---

### **Step 1: Simulating Healthcare EDI Claim Data**
We'll create a sample dataset representing a subset of EDI 837 claim data in CSV format.

#### Sample EDI 837 Data (claims.csv):
```csv
ClaimID,PatientID,ProviderID,ServiceDate,AmountCharged,DiagnosisCode,InsuranceID,Age
C001,P001,PR001,2025-01-10,500.00,D1234,INS001,45
C002,P002,PR002,2025-01-11,1200.50,D5678,INS002,17
C003,P003,PR003,2025-01-12,300.00,D1111,INS003,70
C004,P004,PR004,2025-01-13,150.75,D2222,INS004,5
```

---

### **Step 2: Validating Data Using Great Expectations**
We define validation checks to ensure the dataset complies with EDI 837 standards.

#### Steps:
1. **Define an Expectation Suite**:
   ```bash
   great_expectations suite new
   ```
2. **Validation Script**:
   ```python
   from great_expectations.data_context import DataContext

   # Initialize Great Expectations context
   context = DataContext()

   # Load the dataset
   data_path = "claims.csv"
   batch = context.get_batch(
       {
           "datasource_name": "my_filesystem",
           "data_connector_name": "default_inferred_data_connector_name",
           "data_asset_name": "claims.csv",
       },
       {"path": data_path},
   )

   # Validate the dataset
   suite_name = "edi_claims_validation"
   results = context.run_validation_operator(
       "action_list_operator",
       assets_to_validate=[batch],
       run_id="validation_run_2025_01",
   )
   context.build_data_docs()
   ```

3. **Validation Expectations**:
   - Ensure `ServiceDate` is in a valid date format.
   - Ensure `AmountCharged` is greater than 0.
   - Ensure `DiagnosisCode` matches a known pattern.

   Example:
   ```python
   batch.expect_column_values_to_be_of_type("ServiceDate", "datetime")
   batch.expect_column_values_to_be_between("AmountCharged", min_value=0.01, max_value=10000)
   batch.expect_column_values_to_match_regex("DiagnosisCode", r"^D\d{4}$")
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Applying Business Rules Using Durable Rules**
Define and execute healthcare-specific business rules.

#### Business Rules:
1. Claims for patients under 18 must have a guardian's insurance ID.
2. Claims over $1,000 require prior authorization.
3. Claims for patients over 65 must flag as "Senior."

#### Durable Rules Implementation:
```python
from durable.lang import ruleset, when_all, when_any, assert_fact

# Define the ruleset
with ruleset("edi_claim_rules"):
    # Rule for patients under 18
    @when_all(c.age < 18)
    def validate_guardian(c):
        if not c.insurance_id:
            print(f"Claim {c.claim_id} missing guardian insurance for patient {c.patient_id}")

    # Rule for high-value claims
    @when_all(c.amount_charged > 1000)
    def require_prior_auth(c):
        print(f"Claim {c.claim_id} requires prior authorization")

    # Rule for senior patients
    @when_all(c.age > 65)
    def flag_senior(c):
        print(f"Claim {c.claim_id} flagged as senior claim")

# Sample execution
claims = [
    {"claim_id": "C001", "patient_id": "P001", "age": 45, "amount_charged": 500, "insurance_id": "INS001"},
    {"claim_id": "C002", "patient_id": "P002", "age": 17, "amount_charged": 1200, "insurance_id": ""},
    {"claim_id": "C003", "patient_id": "P003", "age": 70, "amount_charged": 300, "insurance_id": "INS003"},
]

# Assert facts
for claim in claims:
    assert_fact("edi_claim_rules", claim)
```

---

### **Step 4: Automation with Robot Framework**
Integrate validation and rule execution in a Robot Framework workflow.

#### Robot Framework Test Suite (edi_claim_tests.robot):
```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    OperatingSystem
Library    Process
Library    BuiltIn

*** Test Cases ***
Validate EDI Claims
    [Documentation]    Validate claim data using Great Expectations
    Run Process    python    validate_claims.py

Execute Business Rules
    [Documentation]    Execute healthcare business rules using Durable Rules
    Run Process    python    execute_rules.py
```

#### Supporting Scripts:
1. **`validate_claims.py`**: Runs the Great Expectations validation.
2. **`execute_rules.py`**: Executes Durable Rules on the claims dataset.

---

### **Step 5: Generating Unified Reports**
1. **Great Expectations Data Docs**:
   - Automatically generated after validation.
   - Includes a summary of validation results.

2. **Durable Rules Logs**:
   - Log rule execution outcomes into a file:
     ```python
     import logging
     logging.basicConfig(filename="rules_execution.log", level=logging.INFO)
     ```

3. **Robot Framework Reports**:
   - Combine validation and rule execution results into Robot Framework’s final HTML report.

---

### **Step 6: CI/CD Integration**
Automate the entire workflow using a CI/CD tool like **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions**:
1. Step 1: Run Great Expectations validation.
2. Step 2: Execute Durable Rules.
3. Step 3: Consolidate reports and notify stakeholders.

---

### **Output Example**
1. **Validation Results**:
   - Great Expectations detects invalid `ServiceDate` or missing `DiagnosisCode`.

2. **Rule Execution Results**:
   ```
   Claim C002 missing guardian insurance for patient P002
   Claim C002 requires prior authorization
   Claim C003 flagged as senior claim
   ```

3. **Robot Framework Report**:
   Includes results from both validation and rule execution.
