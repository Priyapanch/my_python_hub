Adding **claim pricing calculations** to the above example can be accomplished by incorporating **pricing rules and formulas** into the pipeline using **Durable Rules** for logic execution and **Python** for complex calculations. Here's how you can enhance the workflow:

---

### **Claim Pricing Calculation Workflow**

1. **Pricing Rules**: Define pricing rules based on service type, age group, insurance type, or other parameters.
2. **Calculation Logic**: Calculate claim prices based on rules and apply discounts, taxes, or penalties.
3. **Integration**: Extend Durable Rules and integrate pricing logic into the workflow.

---

### **Step 1: Define Pricing Rules**

#### Sample Rules:
1. **Base Pricing**:
   - Claims under $500 are charged a flat rate.
   - Claims between $500 and $1,000 are charged at 80% of the `AmountCharged`.
   - Claims over $1,000 are charged at 70% of the `AmountCharged`.

2. **Senior Discount**:
   - Patients over 65 receive a 10% discount on the final price.

3. **Pediatric Discount**:
   - Patients under 18 receive a 5% discount.

4. **Taxation**:
   - Apply a 5% tax to all claims after discounts.

---

### **Step 2: Extend Durable Rules for Pricing Logic**

Hereâ€™s how to implement the above pricing rules using **Durable Rules**:

#### Durable Rules Code:
```python
from durable.lang import ruleset, when_all, assert_fact
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="pricing_log.log", level=logging.INFO)

# Define the ruleset
with ruleset("claim_pricing_rules"):

    # Rule for base pricing
    @when_all(c.amount_charged < 500)
    def flat_rate_pricing(c):
        c.price = 100  # Flat rate for claims under $500
        logging.info(f"Claim {c.claim_id}: Flat rate applied. Final Price = {c.price}")

    @when_all((c.amount_charged >= 500) & (c.amount_charged <= 1000))
    def mid_range_pricing(c):
        c.price = c.amount_charged * 0.8
        logging.info(f"Claim {c.claim_id}: 80% pricing applied. Final Price = {c.price}")

    @when_all(c.amount_charged > 1000)
    def high_value_pricing(c):
        c.price = c.amount_charged * 0.7
        logging.info(f"Claim {c.claim_id}: 70% pricing applied. Final Price = {c.price}")

    # Rule for senior discount
    @when_all(c.age > 65)
    def senior_discount(c):
        c.price *= 0.9  # 10% discount
        logging.info(f"Claim {c.claim_id}: Senior discount applied. Final Price = {c.price}")

    # Rule for pediatric discount
    @when_all(c.age < 18)
    def pediatric_discount(c):
        c.price *= 0.95  # 5% discount
        logging.info(f"Claim {c.claim_id}: Pediatric discount applied. Final Price = {c.price}")

    # Rule for taxation
    @when_all(+c.price)
    def apply_tax(c):
        c.price *= 1.05  # 5% tax
        logging.info(f"Claim {c.claim_id}: Tax applied. Final Price = {c.price}")

# Sample claims
claims = [
    {"claim_id": "C001", "amount_charged": 500, "age": 45},
    {"claim_id": "C002", "amount_charged": 1200, "age": 17},
    {"claim_id": "C003", "amount_charged": 300, "age": 70},
    {"claim_id": "C004", "amount_charged": 150, "age": 5},
]

# Execute pricing rules
for claim in claims:
    assert_fact("claim_pricing_rules", claim)

# Output logged pricing details
with open("pricing_log.log", "r") as log_file:
    print(log_file.read())
```

---

### **Step 3: Pricing Calculation Workflow**
1. Load claims data (`claims.csv`).
2. Pass each claim through the pricing rules.
3. Log and output the calculated prices.

---

### **Sample Output**

#### Logs:
```plaintext
Claim C001: 80% pricing applied. Final Price = 400.0
Claim C002: 70% pricing applied. Final Price = 840.0
Claim C002: Pediatric discount applied. Final Price = 798.0
Claim C002: Tax applied. Final Price = 837.9
Claim C003: Flat rate applied. Final Price = 100
Claim C003: Senior discount applied. Final Price = 90.0
Claim C003: Tax applied. Final Price = 94.5
Claim C004: Flat rate applied. Final Price = 100
Claim C004: Pediatric discount applied. Final Price = 95.0
Claim C004: Tax applied. Final Price = 99.75
```

#### Final Pricing:
| ClaimID | Base Price | Discounts   | Tax     | Final Price |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| C001    | $500.00    | $0.00       | $20.00  | $400.00     |
| C002    | $1200.00   | $42.00      | $39.90  | $837.90     |
| C003    | $300.00    | $10.00      | $4.50   | $94.50      |
| C004    | $150.00    | $5.00       | $4.75   | $99.75      |

### **Step 4: Integration with Robot Framework**

Extend the **Robot Framework** test suite to include pricing calculations.

#### Robot Framework Test Case (edi_claim_tests.robot):
```robot
*** Test Cases ***
Validate EDI Claims
    Run Process    python    validate_claims.py

Execute Business Rules
    Run Process    python    execute_rules.py

Calculate Claim Pricing
    Run Process    python    calculate_pricing.py
```

---

### **Step 5: Reporting**
1. Combine validation, rule execution, and pricing results into a unified report.
2. Output:
   - Final pricing in a CSV/JSON format.
   - Robot Framework HTML reports.
   - Logs for auditing purposes.
